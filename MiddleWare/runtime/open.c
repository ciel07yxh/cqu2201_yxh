 * implementation.
 *
 * The "__open" function opens the file named "filename" as specified
 * by "mode".  "mode" & _LLIO_RDWRMASK specifies the basic file type:
 * _LLIO_RDONLY, _LLIO_WRONLY, and _LLIO_RDWR for read only, write only, and
 * read write, respectively.  Handle the rest of the _LLIO_xxx flags as
 * described in the code below.
